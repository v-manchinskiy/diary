## ‚úîÔ∏è Preparing to create a new site

Instal Hugo Extended last version as stated here: [Hugo Docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Below I describe my version of this process **for Windows 10 users**.

1. Go to the Hugo releases page: [GitHub](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).
2. Find and download the latest release of **Hugo Extended** for your operating system, the 32-bit or 64-bit file depending on whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.
3. Move the dowloaded ZIP file into your Hugo bin folder: `C:\Hugo\bin` and extract it into the current folder. Now you're supposed to have three new files here: `hugo` (executable), `LICENSE`, `README`.

4. Add Hugo to your Windows PATH settings:
    - Right click on the Start button.
    - Click on System.
    - Click on Advanced System Settings on the left.
    - Click on the Environment Variables‚Ä¶ button on the bottom.
    - In the User variables section, find the row that starts with PATH (PATH will be all caps).
    - Double-click on PATH.
    - Click the New‚Ä¶ button.
    - Type in the folder where `hugo.exe` was extracted, which is `C:\Hugo\bin` if you went by the instructions above. The PATH entry should be the folder where Hugo lives and not the binary. Press Enter when you‚Äôre done typing.
    - Click OK at every window to exit.

üëç So, all the preliminary preparations are done.

## üí° Now you will create a new Hugo site

Run [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) app. In Terminal tab write: `hugo new site hugo-test` . Words "hugo-test" you can replace with your own site name.
